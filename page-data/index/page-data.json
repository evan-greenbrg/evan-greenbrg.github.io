systems. \nWhile we can measure the rates of channel migration and witness singular avulsion events in modern rivers, these studies fail to capture the long-term relationship between these processes that ultimately dictates sediment preservation over geologic timescales. \nWe leverage ancient fluvial deposits to reconstruct paleo-channel mobility, begin to test the theory regarding the long-term behavior of river migration and avulsion, and explore the sensitivity of river mobility to past cases of extreme climate change. \nHere, we reconstruct the paleo-channel mobility from the fluvial deposits of the Willwood Formation (Bighorn Basin, Wyoming) and test hypotheses regarding potential changes in channel mobility in response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) global warming event. \nWe identified avulsion-generated channel-belt deposits and made detailed maps of intra-channel-belt facies and architecture with a particular focus on constraining the scale, stacking, lateral continuity, and preservation of bar deposits. \nWe also calculate hydraulic parameters such as paleo-discharge, paleo-slope, Parker stability criterion, and channel mobility number. \n<p>Results suggest that the Willwood rivers were extremely laterally mobile meandering rivers, confirming previous interpretations, and that their lateral mobility remained insensitive to the PETM climate change.\nHowever, an apparent increase in avulsion reoccupation at the channel-belt scale through the peak of the PETM suggests either that net-sediment supply decreased relative to subsidence, in-channel sedimentation increased relative to floodplain sedimentation, or the presence of channel-belt clustering within the Bighorn Basin.\nThis study introduces a framework that allows ancient rivers to be directly compared to modern river and can be used to make predictions about which river systems are most susceptible to future climate change.</p>\n</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"River Mobility and Climate Change in Ancient
