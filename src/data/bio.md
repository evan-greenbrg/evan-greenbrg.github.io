Welcome!

I am currently a Data Engineer at TwoNil LLC, a small advertising and analytics technology company. 
We use Python and Spark within the AWS ecosystem to manage up to 1TB of data daily. 
I work on the development and maitanence of our end-to-end data pipeline as well as the deployment of our machine learning products.

Previously, I was a Graduate Research Assistant and MS student in the Department of Geosciences at Penn State University.
My degree was research intensive, where I studied extreme climate, river mechanics, and the sedimentary record. 
My coursework was in field geology, computational modeling, and advanced surface processes.

Currently, I am most intersted in how modern technologies such as machine learning and remote sensing can be used
alongside classical methods to study the effect of modern and ancient climates on landscape dynamics.
